## Optimizing Content Strategy Based on LinkedIn Analytics (May-August 2024)
### Introduction
This analysis provides insights into my LinkedIn content performance for 90 days (May 4th, 2024, to August 1st, 2024). The analysis was carried out using R.

### Methodologies
1. Data Loading and Preparation.
2. Data Cleaning and Wrangling.
3. Data Analysis and Visualization.

### Conclusion
Analyzing my LinkedIn performance from May to August 2024, I have gained valuable insights into my audience: predominantly Entry-level Data Analysts in Lagos, working in IT Services and IT Consulting at small to medium-sized companies. While July was the top-performing month and May saw significant new followers growth, inconsistent content performance highlights the need for strategic refinement.

With these findings, I can now optimize my content and engagement approach to foster continued growth and connection with my audience.
